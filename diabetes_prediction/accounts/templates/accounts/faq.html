                                        The Diabetes Prediction System is an advanced tool that uses machine learning algorithms to assess your risk of developing diabetes based on various health factors, lifestyle choices, and medical history. It provides personalized recommendations to help you manage and reduce your risk.

                                        Our prediction model has been trained on a large dataset and has an accuracy of approximately 85-90%. However, it's important to note that this is not a medical diagnosis. The prediction is based on statistical analysis and should be used as a screening tool only. Always consult with a healthcare professional for proper diagnosis and treatment.

                                        For most people, checking your diabetes risk once every 6-12 months is sufficient. However, if you've made significant lifestyle changes or have been diagnosed with prediabetes, you might want to check more frequently (every 3-6 months) to monitor your progress. Always follow the advice of your healthcare provider regarding the frequency of health assessments.
